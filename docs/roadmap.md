# AgentGate — Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-03-15

A lean, prioritized list of work for AgentGate. Each item is a short name, one-line description, and a link to a feature document under `docs/features/`.

If adding a new item, create a feature document using `docs/features/_template.md` before implementation; the template ensures consistent scope, tests, and versioning guidance.
