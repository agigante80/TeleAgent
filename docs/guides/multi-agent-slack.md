# How to Run Multiple Agents in a Slack Workspace

This guide shows how to run multiple AgentGate instances as specialised AI agents in a single Slack workspace. We use the AgentGate project itself as the working example.

See also: [`docs/guides/slack-setup.md`](slack-setup.md) for single-agent setup. `SLACK_DELETE_THINKING` and `SLACK_THREAD_REPLIES` are documented in README and `.env.example`.

## What you'll set up

Three agents, one `#agentgate` Slack channel:

| Agent | Trigger prefix | Backend | Model | Extra files |
|-------|---------------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `@GateCode` — Developer | `dev` | Codex | `gpt-5.3-codex` | none (auth managed automatically) |
| `@GateSec` — Security | `sec` | Copilot | `claude-opus-4.6` | `skills/sec-agent.md` via `COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS` |
| `@GateDocs` — Docs writer | `docs` | Gemini | `gemini-2.5-flash` | `.gemini/GEMINI.md` context file |

You can mix and match backends freely — all three can use the same backend, or each can be different.

**Prerequisites**: A Slack workspace where you can install apps, Docker, and the credentials for at least one AI backend.

---

## How agents trigger

Agents respond to two types of messages:

**Prefix trigger** — messages starting with the agent's prefix:
```
dev explain the history module      ← @GateCode responds
sec review src/executor.py          ← @GateSec responds
docs write a README for this func   ← @GateDocs responds
```

**@mention trigger** — directly @mentioning the bot anywhere in a message:
```
@GateCode what's the status of the auth refactor?   ← GateCode responds (bypasses PREFIX_ONLY)
@GateSec are you available?                          ← GateSec responds
```

With `PREFIX_ONLY=true` (required for multi-agent), each bot silently ignores unprefixed messages from human users. @mentions always get a response regardless of `PREFIX_ONLY`.

---

## Agent isolation and awareness

Each agent is an independent container with its own clone of the repo and history DB:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Do agents see each other's replies? | No — each has its own isolated SQLite history DB |
| Do agents respond to each other's messages? | No by default — bots ignore bot messages |
| Can agents request work from each other? | Yes, via `TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS` (see below) |
| Do agents respond to `@here` or `@channel`? | No — `PREFIX_ONLY=true` ignores these |
| Does each agent know its teammates? | **Yes** — team context is auto-generated at startup |

### Auto-generated team context

At startup, each agent automatically builds a team context string and prepends it to every AI prompt. This means bots always know who they are, who their teammates are, and how to address them — without any manual configuration:

```
You are GateCode (prefix: dev).
Your team in this Slack workspace:
  - GateSec (prefix: sec) — users address them with: sec <message>
  - GateDocs (prefix: docs) — users address them with: docs <message>
Repo: agigante80/AgentGate | Branch: develop
Formatting (Slack mrkdwn): *bold* (NOT **bold**), _italic_, `inline code`, ```code blocks```, >blockquote, - bullet list
```

This context is derived automatically from `BOT_CMD_PREFIX`, `TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS` (including their prefixes), and `GITHUB_REPO`/`BRANCH`. No additional env var is needed.

> **Why team context and not skills files?** Skills files (`COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS`) are loaded by **both Slack and Telegram** deployments. Platform-specific instructions (like Slack mrkdwn syntax) must go in the team context, which is Slack-only code. This keeps skills files platform-neutral and reusable.

### Optional `SYSTEM_PROMPT`

You can add a `SYSTEM_PROMPT` env var to each `.env` file for agent-specific role descriptions or persona customisation. It is appended after the auto-generated team context:

```bash
SYSTEM_PROMPT=You are a security-focused code reviewer. Always check for injection vulnerabilities, insecure defaults, and missing input validation.
```

Leave it empty (default) to rely entirely on the skills files.

---

## Agent-to-agent requests

You can configure agents to delegate work to each other. For example, after `@GateCode` writes a fix, it can automatically ask `@GateSec` to review it.

### Delegation sentinel protocol (v0.10+)

Each agent's AI is automatically instructed (via the team context injected into every prompt) to use a structured delegation sentinel:

```
[DELEGATE: <prefix> <full message to send>]
```

The bot:
1. Strips the sentinel from the displayed response (it never appears in chat)
2. Posts `<prefix> <message>` as a new standalone channel message
3. The target agent's bot sees the message, recognises its prefix, and routes it to its AI pipeline

**Example end-to-end flow:**

```
Human: dev analyse the auth module for security issues

GateCode AI responds (displayed):
  "I've reviewed auth.py. The token generation looks weak."

Behind the scenes, GateCode also emitted:
  [DELEGATE: sec Please review auth.py — generate_token() uses random.random() instead of secrets.token_bytes()]

GateSec sees: "sec Please review auth.py — generate_token() uses …"
GateSec AI responds (new message):
  "⚠️ Confirmed: random.random() is not cryptographically secure. Use secrets.token_bytes(32)."
```

**No skills file changes needed** — delegation instructions are injected automatically via `_build_team_context()`. Both agents must have each other in `TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS`.

**Security guardrails (built-in):**
- Delegations starting with dangerous sub-commands (`run`, `sync`, `git`, `diff`, `log`, `restart`, `clear`, `confirm`) are *silently blocked* and logged — this prevents the AI from triggering arbitrary shell execution on a peer agent.
- At most 3 delegation blocks are processed per AI response (flood prevention).
- Prefixes are normalised by the runtime: they are lowercased and `-`/`_` are removed; use the normalised prefix in sentinels (see `src/platform/slack.py::_prefix()`).

**Loop prevention**: Trusted agent messages are *never* forwarded to the AI pipeline — they only trigger named prefix commands via `_dispatch()`. Delegation chains are at most one hop: human → agent A → agent B. Agent B cannot further delegate back to A.

**How the routing works:**

1. Each agent's `TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS` lists its teammates by display name and prefix (e.g. `"GateCode:dev"`)
2. AgentGate resolves each name to an internal Slack `bot_id` at startup via `users.list`
3. When a message arrives from a trusted bot, it is dispatched via `_dispatch()` — only known prefix sub-commands are accepted
4. The AI pipeline is **never** reached for trusted bot messages

**Finding a bot's `bot_id`**: You don't need to. Use the bot's **display name and prefix** (e.g. `"GateCode:dev"`) directly in `TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS` — AgentGate resolves the name to the internal `bot_id` automatically at startup via the Slack API. The `:prefix` suffix tells each agent how to address its teammates in the auto-generated team context.

**Format**: `"DisplayName:prefix"` (e.g. `"GateSec:sec"`). The `:prefix` part is optional but strongly recommended — without it the team context won't include how to address that agent.

---

## Step 1 — Backend-specific setup

Each backend has different credentials, optional persona/context files, and runtime behaviour. Pick the backend for each agent and follow the relevant subsection.

---

### Copilot backend (`AI_CLI=copilot`)

**Required env vars:**
```bash
AI_CLI=copilot
AI_MODEL=claude-opus-4.6        # or any model from GitHub Copilot's roster
COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...    # GitHub PAT with Copilot access
COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS=/repo/skills
```

**Skills / persona files** (optional but recommended):

Skills files live in `skills/` inside the cloned repo. The container automatically has them at `/repo/skills/` — no host copy or volume mount needed.

```
skills/dev-agent.md   ← Developer persona
skills/sec-agent.md   ← Security engineer persona
skills/docs-agent.md  ← Technical writer persona
```

Set `COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS=/repo/skills` in the agent's `.env`. Multiple directories are colon-separated. The skills files are loaded by the Copilot CLI at subprocess spawn time; you can update them with `<prefix> sync` (git pull) and restart without rebuilding.

**Notes:**
- `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` must be a GitHub Personal Access Token with an active Copilot subscription.
- Copilot is **stateless** — each query spawns a fresh subprocess. History is injected by the bot layer via `HISTORY_TURNS` (default 10 turns).
- `AI_MODEL` selects the model; see the [GitHub Copilot model comparison](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison) for the full list.

---

### Codex backend (`AI_CLI=codex`)

**Required env vars:**
```bash
AI_CLI=codex
AI_MODEL=gpt-5.3-codex           # or other Codex-compatible model
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...        # OpenAI API key with Codex access
```

**No separate skills files** — Codex is configured entirely via env vars and the system prompt. To inject a persona, use `SYSTEM_PROMPT` or `SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE`.

**Auth mechanism:**

Codex writes credentials to `/data/.codex/auth.json` (inside the container, where `HOME=/data`). AgentGate re-runs `codex login --with-api-key` before every invocation to ensure this file stays correct. No manual action is needed, but note:

- The `/data` volume must be writable. In `docker-compose.yml`, bind-mount `./data/<agent>:/data` (per-agent folder, not shared).
- If you see `Reconnecting... 1/5 (unexpected status 401)` errors in logs, the API key is wrong or the volume has stale auth from a previous run. Run `docker compose down && docker volume rm <vol>` and restart.

**Sandbox mode:**

Codex runs shell commands as part of its agentic workflow. The sandbox level is controlled by `CODEX_SANDBOX`:
```bash
CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write   # default — only /repo, /tmp, /data are writable
CODEX_SANDBOX=danger-full-access   # unrestricted — use only in trusted environments
```

**Notes:**
- Codex is **stateful** — it maintains its own conversation context across calls. `HISTORY_TURNS` is ignored for Codex.
- Responses can be long (full shell output, file diffs). Use `SLACK_MAX_CHARS` to truncate if needed.
- A 300-second timeout per call is enforced. Long agentic tasks may hit this; use `dev cancel` to abort.

---

### Gemini backend (`AI_CLI=gemini`)

**Required env vars:**
```bash
AI_CLI=gemini
AI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash        # or gemini-2.5-pro, etc.
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...            # from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
```

**Context file (`.gemini/GEMINI.md`):**

Gemini CLI automatically loads a `GEMINI.md` file from the working directory if present. In AgentGate's Docker setup, `HOME=/data`, so Gemini looks for `/data/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. This file acts as a persistent, always-on persona/context that Gemini reads on every invocation — without any tool activation or API call.

To provide an agent-specific persona for a Gemini-powered agent:

1. Create a context file for the agent, e.g. `gemini-context/docs-agent.md` alongside your `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Copy it into the data volume before starting the container:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./data/docs/.gemini
   cp ./gemini-context/docs-agent.md ./data/docs/.gemini/GEMINI.md
   ```
3. Add this copy step to your `rebuild-all.sh` (or equivalent) so it runs on every fresh deployment.

The repo contains a ready-made example at `.gemini/docs-agent.md` which you can use as a starting point.

> **Important:** `GEMINI.md` is gitignored in AgentGate's repo root (it's auto-generated by Gemini CLI as a workspace summary). Your custom agent context files (`gemini-context/*.md`) should live in a separate directory and be committed to your repo.

**Notes:**
- Gemini is **stateless** — history is injected by the bot layer via `HISTORY_TURNS`.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is validated at startup; missing it causes an immediate fatal error.
- The CLI always runs with `--non-interactive` (headless) and `--yolo` (auto-approves tool calls). Do not use Gemini in an environment where unrestricted tool execution is unacceptable.
- `AI_CLI_OPTS` can pass additional flags, but `--non-interactive` and `--yolo` cannot be removed.
- Free-tier quota: Gemini 2.5 Flash — 1,500 req/day, 1 million tokens/min. [Check current limits.](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)

---

## Step 2 — Create Skills Files

Clone or copy the ready-made skills files from `skills/` in this repository:

```bash
# These files are already in the repo:
skills/dev-agent.md    # Developer persona — Python/AgentGate stack
skills/sec-agent.md    # Security engineer — STRIDE, OWASP, AgentGate threat vectors
skills/docs-agent.md   # Technical writer — AgentGate doc conventions
```

You can customise these files to fit your team. For inspiration, see:
- [msitarzewski/agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) — structured role-based personas
- [f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) — large community prompt library
- [danielmiessler/fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) — composable system prompts
- [Anthropic's prompt library](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/resources/prompt-library/library)

---

## Step 3 — Create Slack Apps (repeat for each agent)

The fastest way is to use an **app manifest** — one paste creates the app with all scopes and events pre-configured.

### 3a — Create the app from a manifest

1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → **From an app manifest**
2. Select your workspace → paste the manifest for each agent below → **Next** → **Create**

**GateCode** (`dev` prefix — Developer agent):

```json
{
  "display_information": { "name": "GateCode" },
  "features": {
    "bot_user": { "display_name": "GateCode", "always_online": false }
  },
  "oauth_config": {
    "scopes": {
      "bot": [
        "channels:history", "groups:history", "im:history", "mpim:history",
        "chat:write", "files:read", "users:read"
      ]
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "event_subscriptions": {
      "bot_events": [
        "message.channels", "message.groups", "message.im", "message.mpim"
      ]
    },
    "interactivity": { "is_enabled": true },
    "org_deploy_enabled": false,
    "socket_mode_enabled": true,
    "token_rotation_enabled": false
  }
}
```

**GateSec** (`sec` prefix — Security agent):

```json
{
  "display_information": { "name": "GateSec" },
  "features": {
    "bot_user": { "display_name": "GateSec", "always_online": false }
  },
  "oauth_config": {
    "scopes": {
      "bot": [
        "channels:history", "groups:history", "im:history", "mpim:history",
        "chat:write", "files:read", "users:read"
      ]
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "event_subscriptions": {
      "bot_events": [
        "message.channels", "message.groups", "message.im", "message.mpim"
      ]
    },
    "interactivity": { "is_enabled": true },
    "org_deploy_enabled": false,
    "socket_mode_enabled": true,
    "token_rotation_enabled": false
  }
}
```

**GateDocs** (`docs` prefix — Docs agent):

```json
{
  "display_information": { "name": "GateDocs" },
  "features": {
    "bot_user": { "display_name": "GateDocs", "always_online": false }
  },
  "oauth_config": {
    "scopes": {
      "bot": [
        "channels:history", "groups:history", "im:history", "mpim:history",
        "chat:write", "files:read", "users:read"
      ]
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "event_subscriptions": {
      "bot_events": [
        "message.channels", "message.groups", "message.im", "message.mpim"
      ]
    },
    "interactivity": { "is_enabled": true },
    "org_deploy_enabled": false,
    "socket_mode_enabled": true,
    "token_rotation_enabled": false
  }
}
```

### 3b — After creating each app

1. **Settings → Basic Information** → scroll to **App-Level Tokens** → **Generate Token and Scopes** → name it anything → scope: `connections:write` → **Generate** → copy the token (`xapp-...`)
2. **Install App** → **Install to workspace** → **Allow** → copy the Bot User OAuth Token (`xoxb-...`)

Repeat for all three apps.

> ⚠️ **If you already created the app and need to add a scope** (e.g. `users:read`): go to **OAuth & Permissions** → **Bot Token Scopes** → add the scope → then **Install App** → **Install to workspace** → **Allow** to get a fresh token. Update `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in your `.env` with the new `xoxb-...` value.

> **Manual setup reference**: If you prefer not to use a manifest, the equivalent manual steps are: Enable Socket Mode, add bot events (`message.channels`, `message.groups`, `message.im`, `message.mpim`) under Event Subscriptions, add bot scopes (`channels:history`, `groups:history`, `im:history`, `mpim:history`, `chat:write`, `files:read`, `users:read`) under OAuth & Permissions, then install to workspace.

---

## Step 4 — Add Bots to the Channel

Each bot must be explicitly added to the Slack channel before it can receive messages there.

For each of the three bots:

1. Open the channel in Slack → click the channel name at the top → **Integrations** tab
2. Click **Add an App** → find and select the bot (GateCode / GateSec / GateDocs)

All three bots should now appear in the channel's integrations list.

---

## Step 5 — Create `.env` Files

```bash
# .env.dev  — Codex backend (agentic, stateful)
PLATFORM=slack
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-dev-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-dev-...
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0123456789
BOT_CMD_PREFIX=dev
PREFIX_ONLY=true
GITHUB_REPO=agigante80/AgentGate
GITHUB_REPO_TOKEN=ghp_...
BRANCH=develop
AI_CLI=codex
AI_MODEL=gpt-5.3-codex
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS=["GateSec:sec","GateDocs:docs"]
SLACK_THREAD_REPLIES=true
```

```bash
# .env.sec  — Copilot backend (stateless, skills-file persona)
PLATFORM=slack
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-sec-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-sec-...
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0123456789
BOT_CMD_PREFIX=sec
PREFIX_ONLY=true
GITHUB_REPO=agigante80/AgentGate
GITHUB_REPO_TOKEN=ghp_...
BRANCH=develop
AI_CLI=copilot
AI_MODEL=claude-opus-4.6
COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS=/repo/skills
TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS=["GateCode:dev","GateDocs:docs"]
SLACK_THREAD_REPLIES=true
```

```bash
# .env.docs  — Gemini backend (stateless, GEMINI.md persona)
PLATFORM=slack
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-docs-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-docs-...
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0123456789
BOT_CMD_PREFIX=docs
PREFIX_ONLY=true
GITHUB_REPO=agigante80/AgentGate
GITHUB_REPO_TOKEN=ghp_...
BRANCH=develop
AI_CLI=gemini
AI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS=["GateCode:dev","GateSec:sec"]
SLACK_THREAD_REPLIES=true
```

> **Note**: `COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS=/repo/skills` points to the `skills/` directory inside the cloned repo — no host copy or volume mount needed.
>
> **Note**: For the Gemini agent, copy the context file before starting: `mkdir -p ./data/docs/.gemini && cp ./gemini-context/docs-agent.md ./data/docs/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (see [Step 1 — Gemini backend](#gemini-backend-ai_cligemini) for details).
>
> **Note**: `TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS` accepts `"DisplayName:prefix"` entries. Names are resolved to Slack bot IDs automatically at startup. The `:prefix` suffix enables auto-generated team context so each agent knows how to address teammates.
>
> **Note**: `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` is required — without it the bot cannot post its 🟢 Ready message. Find it by clicking the channel name → **Channel details** → ID at the bottom (starts with `C`). See [`docs/guides/slack-setup.md`](slack-setup.md) for the full single-agent setup guide.

---

## Step 6 — Docker Compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.multi-agent.yml

services:

  dev:
    image: ghcr.io/agigante80/agentgate:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env.dev
    volumes:
      - repo_dev:/repo
      - ./data/dev:/data
    labels:
      agentgate.agent: dev

  sec:
    image: ghcr.io/agigante80/agentgate:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env.sec
    volumes:
      - repo_sec:/repo
      - ./data/sec:/data
    labels:
      agentgate.agent: sec

  docs:
    image: ghcr.io/agigante80/agentgate:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env.docs
    volumes:
      - repo_docs:/repo
      - ./data/docs:/data
    labels:
      agentgate.agent: docs

volumes:
  repo_dev:
  repo_sec:
  repo_docs:
```

Each agent has its own named volume for `/repo` (the cloned git repo) and its own local `./data/<agent>/` folder for `/data` (SQLite history DB, logs). The three `data/` folders are fully isolated — no write conflicts between agents.

Skills files (`skills/`) live inside the cloned repo at `/repo/skills/` — no host copy needed. `COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS=/repo/skills` points there directly.

---

## Step 7 — Launch and Verify

```bash
# Launch all three agents
docker compose -f docker-compose.multi-agent.yml up -d

# Check they're all running
docker compose -f docker-compose.multi-agent.yml ps

# Tail a specific agent's logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.multi-agent.yml logs -f sec
```

Each bot posts a 🟢 Ready message on startup. Test each:

```
dev what's the architecture of the history module?
sec review src/executor.py for injection vulnerabilities
docs write a one-paragraph overview of the Slack integration
```

---

## Thread Reply Mode

When multiple agents respond to the same message in a busy channel, the root feed becomes noisy quickly. Set `SLACK_THREAD_REPLIES=true` in each agent's `.env` to keep all bot output — AI responses, command output, and delegation messages — inside a thread anchored to the triggering message.

```bash
# .env (per agent)
SLACK_THREAD_REPLIES=true
```

**How it works:**

- If the triggering message is at channel root, the bot starts a new thread anchored to that message (`ts`).
- If the triggering message is already inside a thread, the bot continues that thread (`thread_ts`).
- When agent-to-agent delegation is also enabled (`TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS`), delegation messages are posted into the same thread, keeping the full chain in one place.

**Example (all three agents with `SLACK_THREAD_REPLIES=true`):**

```
#agentgate (channel root):
  You: "dev review auth.py"

  Thread under your message:
    GateCode: ⏳ Thinking…
    GateCode: "Here's my review: ..."
    GateSec:  "sec Here's the security review: ..."   ← delegation
    GateDocs: "docs Here's the doc update: ..."        ← delegation
```

All conversation stays in a single thread. The channel root only shows your original message.

> **Default:** `false` — existing deployments are unaffected. Each agent can be configured independently (some threaded, some channel-root).

---

## Channel strategy

| Strategy | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| **Single channel, all agents** (`SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` all the same) | Small team, easy discovery, cross-pollination (seeing `sec` flag what `dev` just wrote) |
| **Dedicated channel per agent** (`#agentgate-dev`, `#agentgate-sec`, `#agentgate-docs`) | Clear separation, reduced noise, sensitive security queries stay private |
| **Shared + specialised** (`#agentgate` for general + private channels for sec) | Balanced — recommended for teams handling sensitive code |

---

## Switching AI backends safely

Switching a running agent's backend (e.g. from Copilot to Gemini) is straightforward but easy to get wrong if done directly on a remote machine. The recommended workflow is **local-first**:

### Why local-first?

- Different backends have different file requirements that must exist *before* the container starts (e.g. Gemini's `GEMINI.md`, Codex's `auth.json`).
- A backend that fails to start silently drops from the Slack channel — no warning, no Ready message.
- Testing locally gives you fast feedback and doesn't interrupt your live workspace.

### Local-first workflow

**1. Test the new backend locally first**

In your local docker directory (e.g. `/home/you/docker/myagentgate/`):

```bash
# Change the AI_CLI and credentials in the agent's .env
nano .env.docs
# AI_CLI=gemini
# AI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
# GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...

# Create any required files for the backend
mkdir -p ./data/docs/.gemini
cp ./gemini-context/docs-agent.md ./data/docs/.gemini/GEMINI.md

# Rebuild and restart only the affected agent
docker compose build --no-cache docs
docker compose up -d docs

# Watch the logs until you see 🟢 Ready
docker compose logs -f docs
```

Send a test message (`docs hi`) and confirm it responds correctly.

**2. Create the backend-specific files (if not already in your repo)**

| Backend | Files to create | Where |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Copilot | `skills/<agent>-agent.md` | In the repo at `skills/`, auto-available at `/repo/skills/` |
| Codex | none | `auth.json` is managed automatically |
| Gemini | `gemini-context/<agent>-agent.md` | Alongside `docker-compose.yml`; copy to `./data/<agent>/.gemini/GEMINI.md` at deploy |

**3. Commit and push to your deployment branch**

```bash
git add gemini-context/docs-agent.md skills/docs-agent.md
git commit -m "feat: switch docs agent to Gemini backend"
git push origin develop
```

**4. Switch the remote deployment**

On the remote machine:

```bash
cd /your/docker/dir
git pull origin develop

# Create backend-specific files if the backend needs them
mkdir -p ./data/docs/.gemini
cp ./gemini-context/docs-agent.md ./data/docs/.gemini/GEMINI.md

# Update the .env file
nano .env.docs  # change AI_CLI, add new credentials

# Rebuild only the affected agent (no --no-cache needed if image is up to date)
docker compose up -d --build docs

# Confirm it started
docker compose logs -f docs
```

> **Tip:** Add the file-copy step to your `rebuild-all.sh` so it runs automatically on every full redeploy and no manual step is forgotten.

---

## Customising agent personas

Each backend has its own mechanism for injecting a persona. Choose the one that matches your backend:

**Copilot — skills files** (`COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS`):

Edit `skills/` files in the repo. The format follows the [agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) structure:

```markdown
---
name: My Agent
emoji: 🤖

## Critical Rules
Non-negotiable constraints.

## Workflow
Step-by-step process for typical tasks.
```

Skills are loaded from `COPILOT_SKILLS_DIRS` at subprocess spawn time. Since they live in the cloned repo at `/repo/skills/`, you can update them with `<prefix> sync` (git pull) without rebuilding — just restart the container after syncing.

**Gemini — `.gemini/GEMINI.md` context file:**

Create a markdown file with the agent's persona and copy it to `./data/<agent>/.gemini/GEMINI.md` before starting the container (see [Step 1 — Gemini backend](#gemini-backend-ai_cligemini)). The Gemini CLI loads this file on every invocation automatically. Update it by editing the source file and re-running the copy step.

**Codex — `SYSTEM_PROMPT` / `SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE`:**

Use the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` env var for inline text or `SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE` for a path to a markdown file. The file must not be inside `/repo`.

```bash
# Inline
SYSTEM_PROMPT=You are GateCode, a senior developer specialising in Python and security.

# Or file-based (mount a separate volume)
SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE=/config/dev-persona.md
```

**All backends — auto-generated team context:**

Regardless of backend, AgentGate automatically prepends a team context block to every prompt (derived from `BOT_CMD_PREFIX`, `TRUSTED_AGENT_BOT_IDS`, `GITHUB_REPO`, and `BRANCH`). No extra config is needed for this.
