# Feature Document Review Process

> This guide defines the automated peer-review workflow every feature doc must pass before
> implementation begins. Any team member (GateCode, GateSec, GateDocs) can be asked to start
> a review — they will coordinate the rest automatically.

---

## How to Trigger

Simply ask any team member in the channel:

```
dev Please start a feature review of docs/features/my-feature.md
```

That agent becomes the first reviewer and the chain starts automatically. No other manual
steps are required until the final approval (or a re-review request) is posted back here.

---

## Review Order

Reviews always run in this fixed order, regardless of who was asked to start:

```
GateCode (dev) → GateSec (sec) → GateDocs (docs)
```

If the request is sent to `sec` or `docs`, they review first, then the chain continues from
the next agent in order (wrapping around so all three always participate).

## What Each Reviewer Checks

### GateCode (dev) — Technical Completeness
- Prerequisites answered and plausible
- Implementation steps are accurate, ordered, and achievable
- File paths and line numbers in "Current Behaviour" are correct
- Test plan covers happy path, edge cases, and failure modes
- Config wiring (`config.py` sub-config, `main.py` init) is correct
- Architecture Notes flag all platform-symmetry and auth-guard requirements
- No implementation steps will introduce regressions in existing tests
- Version bump classification is correct

### GateSec (sec) — Security & Safety
- No new secret/token is stored in plaintext without `SecretRedactor` coverage
- New env vars holding credentials go in the right sub-config with `Field(env=…)`
- Auth guards (`@_requires_auth` for Telegram; `is_allowed()` for Slack) are present
  on every new handler
- Shell command interpolation uses `sanitize_git_ref()` or equivalent
- No user-controlled input reaches a subprocess unsanitised
- New DB tables/columns do not store unredacted secrets (redaction ordering preserved)
- Any network endpoint (HTTP listener, webhook) documents its allowlist/auth model

### GateDocs (docs) — Clarity & Documentation
- Problem Statement is clear and user-facing (not implementation-centric)
- Config variable table is complete and follows naming conventions
- "Files to Create / Change" table is complete and accurate
- README update instructions are specific enough to execute without re-reading the code
- Acceptance Criteria are unambiguous and testable
- Open Questions are resolved or have a concrete proposed answer
- Feature title and status line are consistent with `docs/roadmap.md`

## Scoring Rubric (1 – 10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **9–10** | Ready to implement. At most minor wording tweaks needed. |
| **7–8** | Needs targeted clarification in 1–2 areas before coding starts. |
| **5–6** | Significant gaps or design ambiguity; needs a rework section. |
| **1–4** | Major issues (missing design, security hole, wrong architecture). |

**Gate**: implementation may not begin until every reviewer's latest-round score is ≥ 9.

---

## Per-Reviewer Protocol

When it is your turn:

1. **Sync to `develop`** — `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/develop`
2. **Read the current doc** — `docs/features/<feature>.md`
3. **Edit the doc** — make inline improvements (fill gaps, fix inaccuracies, add notes).
   Write directly in the doc; do not leave comments-only. The doc should be better after
   your review than before.
4. **Update your row in the Team Review table** — see format below.
5. **Commit to `develop`** — commit message: `docs: [dev|sec|docs] review round N — <feature>`
6. **Delegate to the next agent** — append a `[DELEGATE: …]` block (see below) or, if you
   are the last reviewer in the round, post the outcome.

---

## Team Review Table (added to every feature doc)

Each feature doc contains this section immediately after the status line:

```markdown
## Team Review

| Reviewer | Round | Score | Date       | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|------------|-------|
| GateCode | 1     | -/10  | -          | Pending |
| GateSec  | 1     | -/10  | -          | Pending |
| GateDocs | 1     | -/10  | -          | Pending |

**Status**: ⏳ Pending review
**Approved**: No — requires all scores ≥ 9/10 in the same round
```

When you complete your review, replace your `-/10` with your actual score and fill in the
date (ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD`) and a one-sentence note summarising your key finding.

## Delegation Messages

### GateCode → GateSec

```
[DELEGATE: sec Feature doc review of `docs/features/<feature>.md` — round <N>.
GateCode score: <X>/10. Please sync to develop, review the doc, make inline improvements,
update your row in the Team Review table with your score, commit to develop, and DELEGATE
to docs when done.]
```

### GateSec → GateDocs

```
[DELEGATE: docs Feature doc review of `docs/features/<feature>.md` — round <N>.
GateCode: <X>/10 | GateSec: <Y>/10. Please sync to develop, review the doc, make inline
improvements, update your row in the Team Review table with your score, and commit to develop.
If ALL scores in round <N> are ≥ 9, mark the doc Approved and notify the channel.
Otherwise summarise the gaps and DELEGATE back to dev for round <N+1>.]
```

### GateDocs → GateCode (re-review round)

```
[DELEGATE: dev Feature doc re-review of `docs/features/<feature>.md` — round <N+1>.
Round <N> scores: GateCode <X>/10 | GateSec <Y>/10 | GateDocs <Z>/10.
Blocking gaps: <list top 2-3 issues from the round>. Please sync to develop, address the
gaps, update your round <N+1> row in the Team Review table, commit, and DELEGATE to sec.]
```

---

## Approval

When GateDocs completes the final review and all scores in that round are ≥ 9:

1. Update the doc's Team Review status line:
   ```markdown
   **Status**: ✅ Approved — round <N>, all scores ≥ 9
   **Approved**: Yes — ready to implement
   ```
2. Change the top-level status line from `Planned` to `Approved`:
   ```markdown
   > Status: **Approved** | Priority: … | Last reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
   ```
3. Commit to `develop`.
4. Post a message to the channel:
   ```
   ✅ `docs/features/<feature>.md` is approved (round <N>).
   Scores: GateCode <X>/10 | GateSec <Y>/10 | GateDocs <Z>/10.
   Ready to implement. Assign to a milestone or ask me to open the implementation PR.
   ```

---

## Re-review Rounds

If any score in a round is below 9, GateDocs does **not** post approval. Instead:

1. List the blocking gaps (2–5 bullet points, one per unresolved issue).
2. Add a new set of rows to the Team Review table for round N+1:
   ```markdown
   | GateCode | 2 | -/10 | - | Pending |
   | GateSec  | 2 | -/10 | - | Pending |
   | GateDocs | 2 | -/10 | - | Pending |
   ```
3. DELEGATE to GateCode with the gap list.

Only the round-N+1 rows count for the ≥ 9 gate; earlier rounds are kept for history.

## Notes

- All commits happen on `develop`. Never commit directly to `main`.
- The reviewing agent is responsible for making the doc _better_, not just scoring it.
  A 6/10 score with a list of gaps is only useful if those gaps are also fixed or
  detailed enough that the next round can fix them.
- If the feature doc does not yet have a Team Review table, the first reviewer adds it.
- The process applies to any file under `docs/features/` except `_template.md`.
